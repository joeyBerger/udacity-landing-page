# Landing Page Project

## Content

Simple project demonstrating a landing page with elements modified in various ways using javascript. This page contains 4 sections of basic content that interacts with javascript to build an interactive navigation bar that scrolls to its corresponding section on click. Beyond the basic requirements of the root functionality, elements are hidable, a 'back to top' button is implemented, and the navigation bar hides on idle moments.
